In office hours we'll cover new and old features of GNPS2 and most importantly we'll take your personal questions about GNPS2, computational mass spectrometry, and any science you want to chat about! We'll start office hours given the time below and keep going until there are no more questions. If office hours get too busy, we will limit each question to 10 min.  


Note: The times of GNPS2 office hours are subject to change each quarter as Ming's teaching schedule shifts. Please check the week of to not be blindsided by any changes.
