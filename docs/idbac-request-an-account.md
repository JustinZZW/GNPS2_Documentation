## IDBac Account Creation
To use IDBac, a GNPS2 account is required. To create an account, please contact us via email (nkrull@uic.edu). Tell us your name and institution, and please use your academic affiliated email address.

Once you have a token, you can create an account [here](https://gnps2.org/user/signup).

GNPS2 is in closed beta to make sure everything is working properly and is slowly ramping up for community use. 

Thank you for your patience!
