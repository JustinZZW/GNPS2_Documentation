## Feature Finding in Agilent Software

The first step is...


## Analysis in GNPS2
### Agilent Explorer 2
Agilent Explorer 2 `.pfa` files contain feature groups, feature tables, and spectra all-in-one. Therefore, upload your `.pfa` file as an `inputspectra` into the workflow, and select all options as you normally would. The `Feature Finding Tool` should be set to `AGILENT_EXPLORER_2`.

You can use the [FBMN workflow](https://gnps2.org/workflowinput?workflowname=feature_based_molecular_networking_workflow) in GNPS2. 

### Other Versions
Be sure to select the AGILENT2 for the Feature Finding Tool.
