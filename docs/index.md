# Welcome to GNPS2 Documentation

[GNPS2](https://gnps2.org/) is a web-based mass spectrometry analysis platform. GNPS2 aids in identification and discovery of new molecules in small molecule and natural products mass spectrometry data. 

As there are many aspects to GNPS, it can be a bit overwhelming. Here is a quick description of main functionalities:

1. Computational Workflows for the Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data
1. Interactive Visualizations of Mass Spectrometry Data and Results
1. Mass Spectrometry Knowledgebase Curation
1. Big Data Integration and Visualization

!!! note "GNPS2 For Industry"
	GNPS2 as a infrastructure is open for the academic community. If you are an industry user - please reach out to [Ming](mingxun.wang@cs.ucr.edu) or the [UCR Technology Transfer Office](tp@ucr.edu) to bring GNPS2 to your organization.
