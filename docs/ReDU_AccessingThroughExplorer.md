# Accessing Pan-ReDU metadata through the Dataset Explorer

It is possible to access metadata partially through the [Dataset Explorer](https://explorer.gnps2.org/).

To do that fill a dataset accession number such as "MSV000083077" into the "GNPS/Metabolights/PX Dataset Accession" field. After that the Metadata to source from can be selected in the "Metadata Source" dropdown menu. You can select:


    - REDU: which will source metadata from ReDU. Notive that not all column but only a selection will be sourced here. 
    - MASSIVE: This will source metadata from MassIVE if available. 

To get full access to all metadata visit the [Pan-ReDU-Dashboard](https://redu.gnps2.org/selection/).
